# Understanding the world of Generative Adversarial Networks (Part 1)

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) belong to the family of generative models. They use the techniques of deep learning and neural network models. We can use GANs to generative many types of new data including images, texts, and even tabular data.

In recent years, GANs have gained much popularity in the field of deep learning. And all of this started from this famous paper by Goodfellow et al. After the introduction of the paper, Generative Adversarial Nets, we have seen many interesting applications come up. This not only includes GANs but also the likes of variational autoencoders as well.

So, in this article, we will get to know about GANs as much as we can
