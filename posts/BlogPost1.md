# Understanding the world of Generative Adversarial Networks (Part 1)

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) belong to the family of generative models (see [OpenAI][1]). 

Making use of Deep Learning (DL) techniques, we can train GANs to generate many types of new data, such as images, texts, and also tabular data.

In recent years, GANs have gained much popularity in the field of DL. And all of this started after the famous paper by [Goodfellow et al][2].

So, in this post, we will get to know about GANs and how it can be useful when working on Machine Learning.


## What Will You Learn in This Post?

1. Introduction to GANs
2. How It Works
3. The Learning Process
4. Applications of GANs

## 1. Introduction

The basic idea of GANs is that they are used to generate images that never existed before. 

They learn about the context of the training samples we have (text, music, objects, animals and so forth) and create new versions of those data that never existed.

Under the hood, they are an unsupervised learning technique. This is because, while training a GAN, we do not provide any label or target to the model.

Probably, the most popular use of GANs are that realistic examples of fake people images (which do not look fake at all) as you can see in the following image.

## 2. How It Works

The general architecture of a GAN is represented by the following image.

*Fig. 2: The architecture of a GAN.*

And as we can see, a GAN has two components: the generator and the discriminator.

* Generator - creates new images
* Discriminator - predict whether the image are real or fake (created from the Generator) 

Both components are neural networks that compete with each other. In other words, the Generator tries to fool the Discriminator with fake images.

Now we are going through the training process of both components and understand how they work as well.

## 3. The Learning Process


## 4. Applications

Nowadays there are lots of applications for GANs. Most of them are related to the Image Processing area.

Bellow we are going to explore some of them.

* Data Augmentation
* Face Anonymization 
* Text to Image
* Photos to Emojis
