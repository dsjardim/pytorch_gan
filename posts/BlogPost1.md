# Understanding the World of Generative Adversarial Networks (Part 1)

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) were introduced by [Goodfellow et al][2] in 2014. They belong to the family of generative models (see [OpenAI][1]). 

Making use of Deep Learning (DL) techniques, we can train GANs to generate many types of new data, such as images, texts, and also tabular data.

In recent years, GANs have gained much popularity in the field of DL. So, in this post, we will get to know about this model and how It can be useful.

## 1. Introduction

The basic idea of GANs is that they are used to generate images that never existed before. 

So, they can learn about the context of the dataset we have (such as text, music, objects, animals and so forth) and create new versions of those data that never existed.

Under the hood, they are an unsupervised learning technique. This is because, while training a GAN, we do not provide any label or target to the model.

Probably, the most popular use of GANs are that realistic examples of fake people images (which do not look fake at all) as you can see in Fig. 1.

## 2. How It Works

The general architecture of a GAN is represented by the following image.

*Fig. 2: The architecture of a GAN.*

And as we can see, a GAN has two components: the **generator** and the **discriminator**.

Both components are Neural Networks that compete with each other. In other words, the Generator tries to fool the Discriminator with fake images.

While training a GAN, the **Generator** tries to generate new fake data from a given noisy sample space. 
And after each iteration, It will learn to create images as much realistic as possible (regarding our dataset).

At the same time, the **Discriminator** tries to distinguish the real data from the generated fake data (created by the generator). 
While training the discriminator, we have to feed It with both real and generated data. 

After a certain number of training epochs, eventually the the discriminator won’t be able to tell whether the data is real or fake. 
When this time comes, we can stop the training and use the generator to create new data for our need.

Now we are going through the training process of both components.   


## 3. The Learning Process

As we saw before, the learning process is a minimax game between two networks, a generator, which generates synthetic data given a random noise vector, and a discriminator, which discriminates between real data and the generator’s synthetic data.

### Training the Discriminator

We can say that the discriminator is a binary classifier that classifies whether a sample is positive or negative.
So, the output of it is a probability of a given sample being real (with label 1) or fake (generated by the generator, with label 0).

## 4. Applications

Nowadays there are lots of applications for GANs. Most of them are related to the Image Processing area.

Bellow we are going to explore some of them.

### Data Augmentation

One of the most currently use of GANs is for data augmentation.

Let's pick a scenario where we have a Machine Learning (ML) model performing badly, but It is happening because It was trained with a poor dataset with almost no variability.

It is in here that GANs can be used for. Whenever we have a poor dataset, we can generate more data from It using GANs. 
Then, we probably would have a ML model with better performance 

So, it is well known that GANs are a very interesting and cool way to generate synthetic data. 
If you became curious about it, you can check this [paper][5] out.


### Face Anonymization 

The core idea of face anonymization is to remove all privacy-sensitive information and also generate a new, realistic face for data visual integrity.

Researches in this area are becoming very popular mostly because applying this technique, companies can use any data for their needs without consent.

You can read more about it in this [paper][6], which the authors proposed a GAN that automatically anonymize faces in images while retaining the original data distribution.
